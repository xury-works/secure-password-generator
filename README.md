# secure-password-generator
This creates a random secure password and copies it to your clipboard right away after generating.
It is limited to a minimum of 30 characters up to no limit.
The slider, which appears after clicking on the dot in the right corner of the window,
defines the strength of the generated password (it adds/removes special characters).
